This is raw data of the entire proteome of dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum of mice prenatally exposed to methadone when they are adolescents. Using a mouse model of prenatal methadone exposure (PME), we performed proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and patch-clamp electrophysiology in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS) to examine synaptic functioning in adolescent PME offspring. PME impacted the proteome and phosphoproteome in a region- and sex-dependent manner. Many proteins and phosphorylated proteins associated with glutamate transmission were differentially abundant in PME offspring. For background on model see: https://elifesciences.org/articles/66230.
