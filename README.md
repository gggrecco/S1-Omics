This is raw data of the entire proteome of the somatosensory cortex of mice prenatally exposed to methadone when they are adolescents.  Using a mouse model of prenatal methadone exposure (PME) that displays delays in somatosensory milestone development, we performed an un-biased multi-omics analysis and investigated synaptic functioning in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), where touch and pain sensory inputs are received in the brain, of early adolescent PME offspring. PME was associated with numerous changes in protein and phosphopeptide abundances that differed considerably between sexes in the S1. Although prominent sex effects were discovered in the multi-omics assessment, functional enrichment analyses revealed the protein and phosphopeptide differences were associated with synapse-related cellular components and synaptic signaling-related biological processes, regardless of sex.
